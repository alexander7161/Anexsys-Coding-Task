Dear class:

It was just pointed out to me that there is an error on the syllabus.  The
"Power, Politics & Conflict" chapter (#18 of the George & Jones text) should
be pp. 643-675.

Also, because we are somewhat behind schedule, you can treat the Anderson
reading for next week as optional.  Hope this  helps a bit.
