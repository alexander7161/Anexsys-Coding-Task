Clayton,

Please, mention this to Shirley. She has to submit  a formal request to me
and I have to approve it and fwd to the IT group. It will take a day or two 
to set up.

Vince-

I can't find Scientific Word on my computer or the list of software 
applications to request. Can you tell me where to get it? Thanks,

Clayton
