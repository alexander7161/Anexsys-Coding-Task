Re: TCW Galileo Aggressive Growth Equities Fund

I spoke with Bob Hanisee from TCW and he confirmed that if you put any more 
monies into the fund before December 20th you would be subject to all of the 
capital gains for the year.  He recommended that we hold off until such time.

I asked him to find out about the Small Cap Growth Fund and Select Equities 
Fund as well, so that we would be well informed about any similar 
circumstances.
