^Sue, this is an issue that is becoming more important as ECI becomes more
involved in local provisioning services. 


;I also believe that the DSL provider
that brought the complaint is a company that we may begin partnering on some 
DSL
delivery with. ;Essentially this ruling is very good and will speed 
competitive
DSL deployment. ;I don't think you will see ECI teaming with anyone to provide
DSL in Minnesota just yet, but we will be doing just that in LA, San Jose, New
York, Chicago, and DC very soon.

Our response: ;this is good, keep it up PUC, and Enron supports expanding
competition. I think we should watch this development -- but I don't think you
should expend any resources at this time.

We can't describe ECI's business as simply wholesale because we often contract
services directly with end-users. ;How we get from our national backbone to 
the
custormer is becoming increasingly important as we reassess our responsibility
to deliver in the "last mile." ;We used to think that the last mile would take
care of itself and that our customers would figure out how to reach us. ;Now, 
we
are increasingly looking at how to better ensure delivery of services and
provide the quality of connectivity it will take for our network to fully be
appreciated.

I hope that helps.
