Included are some notes on monopoly, competitive, and 2part tariff profit
maximization in the short-run. The colorful graphs in these notes are not
my creations.  I am a shameless internet graphics pillager. More notes
will be coming later. In other
news. . . evidently the Oct. 9 Berkeley review session will be moved up to
9 AM.  I'll be exploring the possibility of moving the Peninsula one up as
well, so you can all make it to your saturday night social mixers.   I'll
keep you updated in the several more emails you are likely to receive from
me this week.
