Dennis,

I spoke with Rick Counihan from Green Mountain who is closely following this 
issue.  He told me that the Commission is scheduled to issue a final decision 
on the CEC credit on Nov. 17.  He spoke with CPUC staff who will be 
recommending that the credit be reduced by 0.25 cents/kWh beginning December 
1, 1999 through June 30, 2000.  Beginning in March or April of next year, 
discussions will resume on what adjustments will be made beginning July 1, 
2000.

Roger
