Steve/Rick -- sorry this is so late, but this should be a good starting point
towards position papers.

Kevin -- check this out and let me know if this is what you were thinking 
about
for you and Steve Elliott's use.  If you want it spread sheet form I can do 
that
as well.  Or if you need me to focus on issues specific to Network 
Development,
I can do that too.
