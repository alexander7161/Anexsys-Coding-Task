Here is our draft of the transaction description for the privatization of the 
electrical distribution system at Edwards AFB.  Please edit to ensure that 
the description matches what Edwards intends to do and email to me.  We will 
use your edited version to characterize the transaction to the CPUC.  

Thanks, 
Bill Gang
