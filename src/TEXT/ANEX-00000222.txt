 In previous all-party meetings Kern has stated its position on key
issues in the Gas OIR. Its position has also been stated in a "positions"
matrix, which was distributed to all parties. At the October 6th meeting
Kern would like to make a short (10 minute) presentation of its current
position with respect to the Interm Proposal put forth by SoCalGas as well
as long-term structural issues. A brief hand-out will be provided at the
meeting.
